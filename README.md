# Cypress Proyect
_This repitory was made as my portfolio for Cypress Framework on Automation Testing. I have made tests with the following criteria:_
* POM (at page folder) for all the interactions with componentes
* Fixture if its necesary for static data
* Faker on random data generated on tests
* Guerkin files (fixture and step definitions files at cucumber-test folder) if it's aplied 
* Basic test file (at Tests folder)
* Reportes en XML al ejecutar en modo headless
* Remove logs funcions (at helpers folder) imported for ignoring exceptions during execution 
* Documentation of each test (at test-plan folder), this will cointain all the criterias based on the design of the tests. Basicaly is the information we recived on the US
* Commands if we need to use some algoritms that are common on all tests or almost all of them
* Work first on a branch and commit all the changes
* PR's have to contains a report of tests results and logs of all commits at least
